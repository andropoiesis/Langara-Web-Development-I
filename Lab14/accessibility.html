		<h1>Accessibility Tests</h1>
		
		<h3>Differences</h3>
		
		<p>
			WebAIM Wave displays the results of the test by displaying the web
			page and placing error/alerts icons directly on the display of the
			page where they occur. Information and suggestions for changes about 
			these errors is displayed on the left column whenever the icons are 
			selected.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			ATRC AChecker divides the results into tabs, listing "Known Problems",
			"Likely Problems", and "Potential Problems". Each tab lists errors by
			further categories such as "Text Alternatives", "Adaptable", and
			"Readable". Within these categories, the line in the page source
			with the error is identified and changes to the line are suggested.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Similarities</h3>
		
		<p>
			Both tests found similar errors:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Hyperlink elements with no text or alt attributes.</li>
			<li>Language of the document is not specified.</li>
			<li>Buttons with no text.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Recommendations for Improvement</h3>
		
		<p>
			First of all, the document language needs to be specified. The html
			element needs to include a lang attribute, in this case, lang="en".
			Next, the button element in the search input field should have an
			alt attribute in which alternative text can be displayed for screen
			readers. Italics elements should be replaced with strong or em elements.
			Since the hyperlink elements have no text, they should have text, or
			a title attribute to identify the hyperlink to screen readers.
